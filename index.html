      <p>  Learning new things is one of the best ways to spend your time.
      This is my latest endeavor. I have been intrigued by computers my whole life.
      I've been learning to code for the web through a program called Codergirl since January.
      This was initially a way to get on a new career path while recovering from an illness.
      Along the way I have met, worked with, and enjoyed the company of an amazing, diverse group
      of incredible women.
      I am so glad the stars aligned for me to have this experience. My path has been forever
      altered by Codergirl. I look forward to getting some more practice working on this site, building
      one for my husband, and eventually my father's business. The goal right now is to get a few more
      tools under my belt in order to become a full stack developer and somewhere along the way I'd also
      like to learn iOS and Android app development. </p>
     <p>
      I also love to work with my hands and create things. I currently work in furniture engineering.
      I work with designers to make sure their designs will function properly and uphold our standards.
      I've designed furniture to custom build for my own home and refinished old pieces too.
      I enjoy art and architecture, and anything beautiful.
