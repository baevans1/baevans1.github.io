        Interior Designer. Makeup Lover. Pitbull Advocate. Theatre Nerd. All things creative.<br>
      I like to work with my hands and create things. I currently work as a furniture and
      custom storage designer. Like schematics and shit. Sure I pick out colors and whatnot
      and have an eye for what actually looks good, but I'm more interested in the technical.
      I've designed furniture to custom build for my own home and refinished old pieces too.
      I  enjoy art and architecture and anything beautiful.<br>
      I have two vicious pitbulls that will lick you to death. My babies are awesome.
      This is my latest endeavor. I'm excited to learn to code for web development.
      Also my sister, Miranda, lives with me and she is annoying. She thinks I should talk
      to a spider to learn to develop webs. It's ok guys. She was homeschooled.
