          <p>  Learning new things is one of the best ways to spend your time.
          This is my latest endeavor. I have been intrigued by computers my whole life.
          I've been learning to code for the web through a program called Codergirl since January.
          This was initially a way to get on a new career path while recovering from an illness.
          Along the way I have met, worked with, and enjoyed the company of an amazing, diverse group
          of incredible women.
          I am so glad the stars aligned for me to have this experience. My path has been forever
          altered by Codergirl. I look forward to getting some more practice working on this site, building
          one for my husband, and eventually my father's business. The goal right now is to get a few more
          tools under my belt in order to become a full stack developer and somewhere along the way I'd also
          like to learn iOS and Android app development. </p>
         <p>
          I also love to work with my hands and create things. I currently work in furniture engineering.
          I work with designers to make sure their designs will function properly and uphold our standards.
          I've designed furniture to custom build for my own home and refinished old pieces too.
          I enjoy art and architecture, and anything beautiful.
          </p>
