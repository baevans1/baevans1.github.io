      <p>  I love to work with my hands and create things. I currently work as a furniture and
        custom storage designer. As in I work with schematics, not throw pillows.
        Sure I pick out colors and what not, and have an eye for what actually looks good,
        but I'm more interested in the technical. I've designed furniture to custom build for
        my own home and refinished old pieces too. I  enjoy art and architecture, really just
        anything beautiful.<br>

        Learning new things is one of the best ways to spend your time.
        This is my latest endeavor. I'm excited to learn to code for web development.
        I look forward to getting some practice building my own site, and one for my
        husband, my father and maybe even a few friends who own small businesses.<br>

        I have two vicious pitbulls that will love you to death.
        Pitbulls get a bad wrap but it's all about the training.
        Every dog species has the ability to bite, and every so often the whole
        world  will turn against one particular breed. Rottweilers, doberman, german shephards
        and now pitties. I used to think pits were scary too. My husband was the one
        to show me the way. My two dogs are Yadi (be sure to ask me about his full name) and
        Dotty, and they have nothing but love in their hearts.
